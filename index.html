<h3>The program</h3>

<p>
In this program you will create a direct access file on a simulated disk.  A 
number of <i>sectors</i> will be allocated for the file and records will be 
written to the sectors using hashing.  The sectors will be <i>buckets</i>, that 
is the hash function will give numbers which identify sectors, not individual 
records.  When buckets fill, overflow buckets (sectors) will be allocated to 
hold the overflowing records.
</p>


<h3>The Disk class</h3>

<p>
You will create a <tt>Disk</tt> class.  The disk used for this program will 
then be an instance of this class.  A disk will be a two dimensional array of 
char, i.e. an array of char arrays.  You should view this as an array of 
<i>sectors</i> where each sector is an array of characters.  The number of 
sectors in a disk and the size of the sectors is arbitrary, but a default size 
is 10,000 sectors on a (rather small) disk with 512 characters in each sector.  The class 
definition for Disk is:</p>

<tt><blockquote><pre>
public class Disk
{
   private int sectorCount;   // sectors on the disk
   private int sectorSize;    // characters in a sector
   private char[][] store;    // all disk data is stored here
   public Disk()    // for default sectorCount and sectorSize
   {}
   public Disk(int sectorCount, int sectorSize)
   {}
   public void readSector(int sectorNumber, char[] buffer)   // sector to buffer
   {}
   public void writeSector(int sectorNumber, char[] buffer)  // buffer to sector
   {}
   public int getSectorCount()
   {
      return sectorCount;
   }
   public int getSectorSize()
   {
      return sectorSize;
   }
}
</pre></blockquote></tt>

<p>
<tt>sectorCount</tt> is the number of sectors in the disk and 
<tt>sectorSize</tt> is the number of characters in a sector.  <tt>char[][] 
store</tt> is a reference to the 2-dimensional array which must be allocated by 
the constructor.
</p>


<h3>Reading and writing to the disk</h3>

<p>
You can only read and write to the disk <i>a sector at a time.</i>  A 
<i>disk buffer</i> which is a character array of the same size as a sector must 
be available.  The <tt>writeSector</tt> method will copy the contents 
of its second parameter (which should be your disk buffer) to the sector whose 
number is the first argument.  The previous contents of the sector will be 
overwritten. The <tt>readSector</tt>  method will copy the contents of 
the sector whose number is the first parameter to the character array which is 
the second parameter.  All access to the disk will be through these two 
methods.  (Note:  The disk buffer you will use will be part of the DirectFile class 
described below.)
</p>

<h3>Direct access files</h3>

<p>
A <i>direct access file</i> stores records in such a way that a record can be 
read or written to the file without reading or writing the entire file.  Each 
record must contain a unique <i>key</i> field.  The value of this key field (the 
"key") will be used to determine where the record is stored on the disk.  The 
record can then be read given only the key.  The file is implemented as a 
<i>hash table</i> using sectors for buckets.  The class definition for 
<tt>DirectFile</tt> is:
</p>

<tt><blockquote><pre>
public class DirectFile
{
   public DirectFile(Disk disk, int recordSize, int keySize,
                     int firstAllocated, int bucketsAllocated)
   {}
   public boolean insertRecord(char[] record)
   {}   
   public boolean findRecord(char[] record)
   {}   
   private int hash(char[] key)
   {}
   private Disk disk;             // disk on which the file will be written
   private char[] buffer;         // disk buffer
   private int recordSize;        // in characters
   private int keySize;           // in characters
   private int recordsPerSector;
   private int firstAllocated;    // sector number
   private int bucketsAllocated;  // buckets (i.e. sectors) originally allocated   
   private int firstOverflow;     // sector number
   private int overflowBuckets;   // count of overflow buckets in use
}
</pre></blockquote></tt>

<p>
To <i>insert</i> a record (<tt>insertRecord</tt> method) the <tt>hash</tt> 
method takes the key for its parameter and returns a hash value in the range 0 
... (<tt>bucketsAllocated</tt> - 1).  The record is then placed in the sector 
corresponding to the hash value.  This is done by reading the sector from disk 
into the <i>disk buffer</i> (the <tt>buffer</tt> field of the 
<tt>directFile</tt>), writing the record into the first available position in 
the buffer, and then writing the buffer back to disk.
</p>

<p>
If the sector is full, the record is placed in the first <i>overflow sector</i> 
which is not full.  Overflow sectors are allocated when needed and records are 
stored in them in the order in which the insertions occur.  To allocate an 
overflow sector just increment the <tt>overflowBuckets</tt> field.  If it is 
the first bucket allocated you must also assign the sector number to the 
<tt>firstOverflow</tt> field.
</p>

<p>
If a record already exists in the file with the given key no insertion will be 
done but <tt>insertRecord</tt> will return <tt>false</tt>.  If an insertion is 
done <tt>true</tt> will be returned.
</p>

<p>
To <i>read</i> a record (<tt>findRecord</tt> method) given its key, hash the 
key, read the corresponding sector, and copy the record from its place in the 
disk buffer into the (char[]) parameter of <tt>findRecord</tt> and 
<tt>true</tt> is returned.  If the record is not found in this sector, but the 
sector is not full, the record is not in the table and <tt>false</tt> is 
returned.  If the record is not found in this sector and the sector <i>is</i> 
full you must search the overflow sectors.
</p>

<p>
Note that the parameter passed to <tt>findRecord</tt> is a reference to
a character array which can hold an entire record.  <tt>findRecord</tt> will
only use the first part of this array (the key) to do its search.  It
will then copy the <i>entire record</i> (if found) into the array
when it returns.
</p>


<p>
For reasons of mercy, no delete operation will be implemented.  Thus you will not
need tombstones in this program.
</p>

<h3>The test program</h3>

<p>
You will create an instance of <tt>Disk</tt> and an instance of 
<tt>DirectFile</tt> which uses that disk.  The disk will have 2000 sectors, 
each having 512 characters.  The file will be created initially allocating 600 
(non-overflow) sectors and will begin at sector 1024.  When needed the first 
overflow sector will follow the last non-overflow sector and when needed more
overflow sectors will be created in the following sectors.
</p>

<p>
The records you store will be  <em>mountain records</em>.  A record will 
consist of 60 characters and will have three fields:
<ul>
<li>name: 27 characters (the key field)</li>
<li>country: 27 characters</li>
<li>altitude (in feet): 6 characters</li>
</ul>

The characters will be either normal printing characters or nulls ('\000') which 
will fill out the remainder of the fields.  If a name or country is too long to 
fit in
the 27 character field it will be truncated to 27 characters. Altitudes will 
be stored as character strings, not ints.
</p>

<p>
Your program will open a (real) file provided for you containing records in the format:
<pre><tt><blockquote>
Shasta, Mount#United States#14162
</blockquote></tt></pre>
with each record on its own line.  The program will reformat each line from the 
input into the 60-character record format and insert it into your direct file.  
The program will then go into a loop displaying a menu offering the choices:
<ul>
<li>Insert new record</li>
<li>Find record</li>
<li>Quit</li>
</ul>
and accept the user's choice.  If the user chooses "Insert new record" the 
program will prompt for the three fields, format a 60-character record with the 
data, And insert the record.  The program will display whether the insertion was 
successful or not.  If the user chooses "Find record" the program will prompt 
for the mountain's name (the key) and will search for a record with that key.  
If a record is found its fields will be displayed in the format:
<pre><tt><blockquote>
Shasta, Mount, United States, altitude: 14162 ft.
</blockquote></tt></pre>
If no record is found a message to that effect will be displayed.  The program 
will run until the user chooses "Quit."
</p>

<h3>To hand in</h3>

<p>
You will hand in 
hardcopy of your source code, a sample terminal session, 
and a readme file stating which parts of the assignment (if any) are incomplete.  For 
the terminal session you will use "mountain data" in the format described above. 
 A file containing the initial data to store on your disk (a <em>large</em> 
number of mountains) will be made available for download from the class website. 
 A list of commands to use for your terminal session will also be posted there.
